    //we can iterate through all the primes

    //welp help
    //iterate through all numbers and add a tally of 
    //uh
    //this is hard
    //ok then complementary counting
    //someone help wtf
    //we need to be able to see if something's been previously banned from another thing
    //imagine we form an adjacency list of random crap
    //sobbing crying dying bruh
    //but it should run in time?
    //if we just look at primes maybe?
    //this is very clearly not gonna work
    //maybe i just go play piano
    //maybe maybe mark
