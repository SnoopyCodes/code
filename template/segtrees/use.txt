in all but boneseg, make sure comb() and def are ok for usage
i now have segtree walk working- needs comparison operators or smth, needs testing
overriding is possible! example usage given- pizzeria queries

more specific use cases:
boneseg is to be used if there is only one segtree needed, and the type is integer/long long
baseseg is if more than one segtree is needed, and supports any node type
segtree is to be used if non commutative ops are used and/or walks
