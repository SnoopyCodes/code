path parent basically means that inside a splay tree (preferred path) it is on the root of the splay tree, but is actually attached from the leftmost node

note that splay trees are ONLY representing preferred paths
access(u):
	splay
	# remove this's preferred child
	r.auxcon = this
	r.par = none
	r = none
	# set a new preferred path to u in all the splay trees above
	while auxcon
		v = auxcon
		splay v
		# remove v's preferred child
		v.r.auxcon = v # we essentially split it into a new path, so give it a way back
		v.r.p = none
		v.r= this
		aux = none # merged
		splay #to make it the root of its aux tree
# we loop because splaying u should give it the auxcon of v, one upwards, which doesn't have preferred path to u/v, by definition of having auxcon
# number of loops = number of preferred child changes
# awesome
# u will become the overall root of the aux tree!


say we have path -1 0 1 2 3 4 and subtree rooted at 0
2 might be root of splay tree (pretty balanced) but there will be auxiliary connect from -1 to 2, not 0
