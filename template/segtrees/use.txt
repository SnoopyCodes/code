boneseg might be the most commonly used-- requires modification for anything other than sum, pretty simple
morebaseseg is struct based and only requires changing comb(), still fat af
segtree is incomplete- it can deal with non commutative ops, but can't do walks yet
compseg is also incomplete- provides operations for different merging
in anything, make sure comb() and def are ok for usage
i now have segtree walk working- needs comparison operators or smth
