    //attempt a greedy
    //each edge that is covered by the current a certain number of times will be covered
    //by all the other permutations a certain amount of times also
    //uhhhhhhhhh ok
    //select certain edges as "max"
    //eysbutno's thing would come in real handy rn
    //but anyways we can do it without that
    //so uh
    //wait we can connect as soon as possible
    //if we find num nodes from one set and num nodes from another set we can query for max stuff
    //bruh
