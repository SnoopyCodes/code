    //count for each element the number of times it appears as left bound
    //in the set of integers for a subarray if i appears, and i - 1 does not appear
    //it is a left bound
    //very simple
    //find subarrays for which i does not appear
    //this is enumerated by gaps between i
    //wowzas
    //it is also possible to find subarrays for combinations of certain elements
    //not appearing
    //thus solved
